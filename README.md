## About
A (hopefully) self-explanatory example demonstrating how to render text in OpenGL 3+ with the help of
[stb-truetype](https://github.com/nothings/stb) library.

The essential part is in the `Example1.cpp` file. Directories `vendor` and `common` contain code
needed for the example to run and are not required for understanging how the library works.
