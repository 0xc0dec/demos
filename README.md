## About
A number of graphics demos made for learning and playing around with. The code is (hopefully) clean and self-documented.
All dependencies are included, project files provided are for Visual Studio 2017.
The solution should "just compile" from the get-go.

## Demos
* `StbTrueTypeOpenGL.cpp`: rendering TrueType font in OpenGL using [stb_truetype](https://github.com/nothings/stb) library.
