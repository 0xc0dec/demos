## About
A set of graphics demos made for learning and playing around with. Code is (hopefully) clean and self-documented, to the best of my abilities. All dependencies are included, project files provided are for Visual Studio 2017. The solution should "just compile"
from the get-go.

## Demos
* `StbTrueTypeOpenGL.cpp` and `StbTrueTypeOpenGLBaked`: example of rendering TrueType font using
[stb_truetype](https://github.com/nothings/stb) library.
